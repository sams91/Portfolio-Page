                This question is often asked: <br>

                How long will the following code continue to print “forever” in 
                the console? <br><br>
                <pre><code>
                    let f = true;

                    setTimeout(() => {
                    f = false;
                    }, 300)

                    while(f) {
                    console.log(“forever”);
                    }

                </code></pre>
                <br>

                The answer: <br>
                FOREVER! <br><br>

                The explanation: <br>
                The setTimeout function cannot execute because the code is stuck 
                in a never-ending loop. The loop never ends because no condition 
                for ending was given. 
                <br><br>
                Break it down:
                <br><br>
                While(f) simply means the function will continue to run as long as f 
                remains true. Because f is assigned the value of true, it will never be 
                false within the while(f) function. While(f) can’t call setTimeout until 
                it finishes printing “forever” in the console. Unfortunately, while(f) 
                will never finish printing “forever” in the console because it is stuck 
                in a never-ending loop. This is why setTimeout is never called and the 
                code doesn’t end in 300 milliseconds.  
                <br><br><br><br>

                If I change the code to this: <br>
                <pre><code>
                    let h = 0;

                    let hi = setInterval(() => {
                    console.log(h++);
                    }, 300);

                    setTimeout(() => {
                    clearInterval(hi);
                    }, 3000)

                </code></pre>
                <br>
                How long will the interval execute?
                <br><br>
                The answer:
                <br>
                The interval is executed every 300 milliseconds then stops 
                in 3 seconds.
                <br><br>
                The explanation:
                <br><br>
                The code inside the setTimeout function is the first to run. 
                It tells setInterval to increment h every 300 milliseconds, but after 
                3 seconds clearInterval will be initiated and the code stops.

                Event loops are another coding concept that can easily be overcomplicated. 
                An explanation of event loops will also require an explanation of how JavaScript runs code: 
                <br><br>
                1) JavaScript is “Single Threaded” which means it runs code one line at a time (for the most part).
                <br><br>
                2) JavaScript contains both Synchronous events and Asynchronous events. Synchronous code will 
                perform one task at a time and will block the execution of all other tasks until the current task 
                is completed. Asynchronous code does not have to wait for the completion of one task before being 
                responsive to another. Asynchronous code is useful when faced with tasks that take a long time to run.
                <br><br>
                3) JavaScript runtime contains a queue that holds messages that are associated with a 
                specific function. The event loop pulls messages from the queue and places the associated 
                function in the call stack.
                <br><br>
                4) One function inside the call stack is executed at a time but that function may need 
                to call other functions to run.
                <br><br>
                5) When everything inside the call stack is finished running the event loop will look 
                to see if the message queue has anything pending. 
                <br><br>
                6) The event loop will take whatever is next in the message queue and place it in the 
                call stack and the whole process starts over.
                <br><br>
                Here is a crude visual representation:

                <br><br><br><br>

                Code is placed in the stack and is processed first in last out (FILO).
